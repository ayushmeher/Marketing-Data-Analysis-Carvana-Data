    "# Quantitative Marketing Analyst Project for Carvana\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to analyze our marketing data, specifically focusing on user click data and subsequent user actions leading up to sales. Each click event is associated with a specific marketing channel, and your task is to attribute user actions to these channels. Your analysis should help us understand the relative performance for each channel.\n",
    
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "There are five datasets provided in CSV format in the data folder that will be preloaded in the starter code. These datasets encompass various aspects of our marketing data. A brief description of each dataset is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Click Data:** This dataset contains all click events that lead users to Vroom.com from various paid marketing channels.\n",
    "- click_datetime\n",
    "- channel_id\n",
    "- user_id\n",
    "  \n",
    "Once customers land on the site, they may find a vehicle they are intefrested in purchasing. When the customer initiates the purchase, this is called a \"lock\" as the vehicle has been locked (i.e., a different customer will not be able to start the purchase process on that same vehicle) until the customer either completes the purchase or backs out. Not every lock will convert to a completed sale.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**2. Lock Data:**  This dataset contains all locks done by users:\n",
    "- lock_id\n",
    "- lock_datetime\n",
    "- user_id\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Sale Data:** This dataset contains all sales:\n",
    "- user_id\n",
    "- lock_id\n",
    "- sale_datetime\n",
    "- sale_id\n",
    "- gross_profit\n",
    "\n",
    "**4: Spend Data:** This dataset contains daily marketing spend:\n",
    "- date\n",
    "- channel_id\n",
    "- spend\n",
    "\n",
    "**5: Ad Channels:** This dataset contains all information for each marketing channel:\n",
    "- channel_id\n",
    "- channel_name\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For the ad channels, the channel_name is in the format of **category-partner_campaign** for the marketing channel. Some channels have separate campaigns within them and some don't. Treat the partnership as its own campaign if it doesn't have one. While we’ve provided dummy names in these datasets, the categories, partners, and campaigns mimic real-life examples (e.g., an advertising category could be social or search, an advertising partner could be Google or Disney, and a campaign could be split into different age groups or other customer segments). **You will need to parse these out for the following questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "We are interested in understanding the relative performance of each marketing channel in 2022 to inform our course of action for the next year. To do so, we need to understand the economics of each channel, with metrics such as Cost total Per Click (CPC = advertising spend divided by total clicks), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC = advertising spend divided by sales), and Return on Investment (ROI = gross profit divided by advertising spend). \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we want to know if there are any partnerships or even individual campaigns which are under or over performing so that we can act appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: You will perform this analysis using **first-touch attribution**, which in marketing terms means identifying the first interaction a user has with our brand and linking it to any later user actions. This involves manipulating the provided datasets to locate the first click each user made through our marketing channels and associating it with any subsequent locks and sales (e.g., a customer who first clicked a KnickKnack ad, then a DatAnkle ad would be fully attributed to the KnicKnack channel, with zero credit given to DatAnkle). This will help identify which channels are most effective at tiating customer journeys that result in sales."

    "<ins>Performance & Economics</ins>\n",
    "- What category of channel has the lowest cost per click?\n",
    "- What are the top three partnerships in terms of sales generated by first touch attribution?\n",
    "- Which campaigns had the most month-over-month percent growth/decline in sales generated from Oct to Dec?\n",
    "- Which partner is the most cost efficient, i.e., has the lowest CAC\n",
    "- Which category of channel has the best ROI? The worst?\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Incrementality</ins>\n",
    "- On average, how many different channels do customers interact with prior to locking a car?\n",
    "- What percentage of sales don't have a click within 90 days prior to the conversion? How can you explain this?\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Open Ended</ins>\n",
    "- Based on what you know about channel performance, what recommendation would you give for re-allocating spend given we are increasing budget by 20% next year?"
